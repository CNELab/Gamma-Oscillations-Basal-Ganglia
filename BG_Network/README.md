The repository hosts the code for simulation of the Basal Ganglia (BG) Network.
The code is written in Python and uses ANNarchy library which is a neural simulator designed for distributed rate-coded or spiking neural networks. 
The core of the library is written in C++. It provides an interface in Python for the definition of the networks. 
For now, two compilers are supported, g++ on Linux and clang++ on OS X.
